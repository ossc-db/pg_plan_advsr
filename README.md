pg_plan_advsr
=============

pg_plan_advsr is a PostgreSQL extension that provides Automated execution plan tuning using feedback loop.
This extension might help you if you have an analytic query which has many joins and aggregates and you'd like to get an efficient plan to reduce execution time. This extension is intended to use in a plan tuning phase at the end of system development.

* Note: For now, This extension is in POC phase. Not production ready.

1 Cookbook
==========

This is a simple example of how to use pg_plan_advsr.
More detailed information will be provided in the sections
[Options](#3-options) and [Usage](#4-usage).
There are Five steps in the example.

First, create two tables:

	create table t1 (a int, b int);
	insert into t1 (select a, random() * 1000 from generate_series(0, 999999) a);
	create index i_t1_a on t1 (a);
	analyze t1;

	create table t2 (a int, b int);
	insert into t2 (select a, random() * 1000 from generate_series(0, 999999) a);
	create index i_t2_a on t2 (a);
	analyze t2;

Second, execute the following queries, and you can get a plan and an execution time.

	explain analyze 
	with x as (
	    select * 
	    from   t1 
	    limit 201
	) 
	select * 
	from (  select *
	        from   t1 
	        where  a in (select a from x)
	     ) tmp,
	       t2 
	where tmp.a = t2.a;

Third, enable feedback loop by the following command.

	select pg_plan_advsr_enable_feedback();

Fourth, execute the previous query (explain analyze ...) twice, and you can see the plan was changed and the execution time was shortened because pg_plan_advsr fixed an estimated row error therefore planner chose more efficient plan than before.

e.g.

#### Before tuning
	
	                                                          QUERY PLAN
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	   CTE x
	     ->  Limit  (cost=0.00..2.90 rows=201 width=8) (actual time=0.011..0.077 rows=201 loops=1)
	           ->  Seq Scan on t1 t1_1  (cost=0.00..14425.00 rows=1000000 width=8) (actual time=0.010..0.036 rows=201 loops=1)

	               ->  HashAggregate  (cost=4.52..6.52 rows=200 width=4) (actual time=0.231..0.296 rows=201 loops=1)
	                     Group Key: x.a
	                     ->  CTE Scan on x  (cost=0.00..4.02 rows=201 width=4) (actual time=0.013..0.148 rows=201 loops=1)
	               ->  Index Scan using i_t1_a on t1  (cost=0.42..4.33 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.003..0.004 rows=1 loops=201)
	                     Index Cond: (a = x.a)
	 Planning time: 0.540 ms
	 Execution time: 329.571 ms
	(16 rows)
	

#### After tuning

The topmost join method is changed from Hash Join to Nested loop. The execution time changed 329 ms -> 34 ms.
	
	                                                        QUERY PLAN
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 Nested Loop  (cost=8.27..971.76 rows=201 width=16) (actual time=0.265..2.148 rows=201 loops=1)
	   CTE x
	     ->  Limit  (cost=0.00..2.90 rows=201 width=8) (actual time=0.016..0.077 rows=201 loops=1)
	           ->  Seq Scan on t1 t1_1  (cost=0.00..14425.00 rows=1000000 width=8) (actual time=0.015..0.042 rows=201 loops=1)
	   ->  Nested Loop  (cost=4.95..875.02 rows=201 width=12) (actual time=0.256..1.251 rows=201 loops=1)
	         ->  HashAggregate  (cost=4.52..6.52 rows=200 width=4) (actual time=0.241..0.314 rows=201 loops=1)
	               Group Key: x.a
	               ->  CTE Scan on x  (cost=0.00..4.02 rows=201 width=4) (actual time=0.019..0.153 rows=201 loops=1)
	         ->  Index Scan using i_t1_a on t1  (cost=0.42..4.33 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.003..0.004 rows=1 loops=201)
	               Index Cond: (a = x.a)
	   ->  Index Scan using i_t2_a on t2  (cost=0.42..0.46 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.003..0.003 rows=1 loops=201)
	         Index Cond: (a = t1.a)
	 Planning time: 1.068 ms
	 Execution time: 34.459 ms
	(14 rows)
	

Finally, you can see plan changes and execution time changes to check plan_repo.plan_history table and pg_store_plans view, if you want. Of course, you can bring the execution plan from the verification environment to other environments because this extension use optimizer hint internally and it is just strings (text).

See: [Usage](#4-usage) for more details.

3 Options
=========

- ``pg_plan_advsr.enabled``

	"ON": Enable pg_plan_advsr. 
	It allows creating various hints for fixing row estimation errors and also for reproducing a plan.
	It also stores them to the plan_history table. If you want to use "auto plan tuning using feedback loop", you have to execute below function "pg_plan_advsr_enable_feedback().
	Default setting is "ON". 

- ``pg_plan_advsr.quieted``

	"ON": Enable quiet mode. 
	It allows to disable emmiting the following messages when your EXPLAIN ANALYZE commmand finished.

	    pgsp_queryid
	    pgsp_planid
	    Execution time
	    Hints for current plan
	    Rows hint (feedback info)
	    and so on

	Default setting is "OFF".

- ``pg_plan_advsr_enable_feedback()``

	This function allows you to use feedback loop for plan tuning.
	Actually, it is a wrapper for these commands:

	    set pg_plan_advsr.enabled to on;
	    set pg_hint_plan.enable_hint_table to on;
	    set pg_hint_plan.debug_print to on;
	
- ``pg_plan_advsr_disable_feedback()``

	This function disables using feedback loop for plan tuning. It is a wrapper for these commands:

	    set pg_plan_advsr.enabled to on;
	    set pg_hint_plan.enable_hint_table to off;
	    set pg_hint_plan.debug_print to off;

4 Usage
=======

TBA

There are two types of usage.

- For auto plan tuning

	First, Run ``select pg_plan_advsr_enable_feedback();``.
	Then, Execute EXPLAIN ANALYZE command (which is your query) repeatedly until row estimation errors had vanished.
	Finally, You can check a result of the tuning by using the below queries:

	  select pgsp_queryid, pgsp_planid, execution_time, scan_hint, join_hint, lead_hint from plan_repo.plan_history order by id;
	  
	  select queryid, planid, plan from pg_store_plans where queryid='your pgsp_queryid in plan_history' order by first_call;
	  
	See shell script file as an example: [JOB/auto_tune_31c.sh](https://github.com/ossc-db/pg_plan_advsr/blob/master/JOB/auto_tune_31c.sh)
	
	If you'd like to reproduce the execution plans on other environments, you'd be better to read the other.


	Note:
	
	- A plan may temporarily worse than an initial plan during auto tuning phase.
	- Use stable data for auto plan tuning. This extension doesn't get converged plan (the ideal plan for the data) if it was updating concurrently.

- For only getting hints of current query to reproduce a plan on other databases

	First, Run ``select pg_plan_advsr_disable_feedback();``. 
	Then, Execute EXPLAIN ANALYZE command (which is your query). 
	Finally, You can get hints by using the below queries:

	  select pgsp_queryid, pgsp_planid, execution_time, scan_hint, join_hint, lead_hint from plan_repo.plan_history order by id;

	e.g.
	
	   pgsp_queryid | pgsp_planid | execution_time |                scan_hint                |     join_hint      |        lead_hint
	  --------------+-------------+----------------+-----------------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------------
	     4173287301 |  3707748199 |        265.179 | SEQSCAN(t2) SEQSCAN(x) INDEXSCAN(t1)    | HASHJOIN(t2 t1 x) +| LEADING( (t2 (x t1 )) )
	                |             |                |                                         | NESTLOOP(t1 x)     |
	     4173287301 |  1101439786 |          2.149 | SEQSCAN(x) INDEXSCAN(t1) INDEXSCAN(t2)  | NESTLOOP(t2 t1 x) +| LEADING( ((x t1 )t2 ) )
	                |             |                |                                         | NESTLOOP(t1 x)     |

	  # \a
	  Output format is unaligned.
	  # \t
	  Tuples only is on.
	    
	  select plan_repo.get_hint(1101439786);
	    
	  /*+
	  LEADING( ((x t1 )t2 ) )
	  NESTLOOP(t2 t1 x)
	  NESTLOOP(t1 x)
	  SEQSCAN(x) INDEXSCAN(t1) INDEXSCAN(t2)
	  */
	  --1101439786
	
	You can use the hints to reproduce the execution plan anywhere. It also can be used to modify the execution plan by changing the hints manually.

	
5 Installation Requirements
===========================

pg_plan_advsr uses pg_hint_plan and pg_store_plans cooperatively.

- PostgreSQL => 10.4 (However, not supported PG11 yet.) 
- pg_hint_plan => 1.3.2
- pg_store_plans => 1.3
- RHEL/CentOS = 7.x (6.x is not tested but I suppose it works)


6 Installation
==============

TBA

There are two methods of how to install: Using Dockerfile or building pg_plan_advsr manually.

- ``Dockerfile (experimental)``

	Operations

		\# cd pg_plan_advsr/docker
		\# ./build.sh
	
	See: build.sh and Dockerfile

- ``Build and install (make && make install)``

	- Prerequisite for installation
		- Install postgresql-devel package if you installed PostgreSQL by rpm files
		- Set the PATH environment variable to pg_config of your PostgreSQL
		- Set these environment variables PGHOST, PGPORT, PGDATABASE and PGUSER since this extension uses them as a connection string. If you didn't set the variables, the connection string is set "host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 dbname=postgres user=postgres" as a default.

8 Limitations
=============

Not supported
------------
 - Handle InitPlans and SubPlans
 - Handle Append and MergeAppend 
 - Fix bese-relation's estimated row error (This is pg_hint_plan's limitation)
